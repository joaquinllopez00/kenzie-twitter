This was a class assignment that was aimed at copying the main functionality of Twitter. It allows users to follow and unfollow users, adding the followed users tweets to current users dashboard, mention (@) other users which causes the tweet to show up in the mentioned users notifications, disappearing after being viewed, it also allowed users to create accounts, and only access protected routes once logged in. No styling was required in this project, so all styling seen in this project was simply to make the UI a little more appealing. The goal of this project was to familiarize ourself with Django's views, forms, and handling of POST requests.
